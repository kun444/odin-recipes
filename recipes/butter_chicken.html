    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Similar to Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken is one of the most popular curries at any Indian restaurant around the world. Aromatic golden chicken pieces in an incredible creamy curry sauce, this Butter Chicken recipe is one of the best you will try! </p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g of chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 spoon of ginger</li>
        <li>a can of tomatoes</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs)</li>
        <li> Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan)</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade).</li>
        <li> Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.</li>
        <li>Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice.</li>
    </ol>
